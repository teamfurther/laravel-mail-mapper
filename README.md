# Email to PHP object matcher

Laravel MailMatch is a Laravel wrapper for our [MailMatch package](https://github.com/teamfurther/mail-match).

MailMatch grabs emails via IMAP and automatically matches them to your Eloquent models.

It's great if you wish to include email in a conversion or project activity feed, in a CRM for example.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

composer require teamfurther/laravel-mail-match

The package will automatically register itself.
